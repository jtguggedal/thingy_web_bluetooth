# Nordic Thingy:52 for Web Bluetooth
**About Thingy:52**

The Nordic Thingy:52â„¢ is a compact, power-optimized, multi-sensor development kit. It is an easy-to-use development platform, designed to help you build IoT prototypes and demos, without the need to build hardware or write firmware. Read more about it [here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Nordic-Thingy-52).

**This repository**

This repository is an attempt to make it easier to start developing applications for Thingy:52 using Web Bluetooth. Web Bluetooth is a JavaScript API that makes it possible to communicate with Bluetooth Low Energy devices in web browsers. The implementation status for different browsers and platforms can be seen [here](https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/web-bluetooth/blob/gh-pages/implementation-status.md). 

This is work in progress, and for now this repository will help you connect to a Thingy:52 and access all services and characteristics except for speaker, microphone, MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), and DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade):

### Get started

- Clone or download this repository, or just copy `js/thingy.js` into your own project.
- If you've used this repository, you can open `index.html` in a supported browser and open the console (ctrl + shift + J or cmd + alt + J). 
- Turn on your Thingy:52. 
- Click the "Connect" button found in `index.html`.
- You can now choose your Thingy:52 and connect to it.
- In the console, you can see the browser connect to the device and discover its services. 
- When connected, the Thingy:52 will use the LED breathe feature and the LED will pulsate with RED light. 
- In the browser, it will also show the current temperature measured by the device in the HTML element below the connect button.

### Examples
The following example will first connect to a thingy:52 with the option logEnabled set to false, then subscribe to and log all incoming data from the temperature sensor. After that we will request the device's name, before setting it to "Thingy". In the end, we set a timeout for 10 secounds before we disconnect from the device.

```javascript

import Thingy from "./js/thingy.js";

const thingy = new Thingy({logEnabled: false});

function myLoggingFunction(data) {
    const temperatureData = data.detail;
    console.log(temperatureData);
}

async function start(device) {
    try {
        await device.connect();
        
        device.addEventListener("temperature", myLoggingFunction);
        await device.temperature.start();
        
        
        const deviceName = await device.name.get();
        console.log(deviceName);

        await device.name.set("Thingy");

        setTimeout(async () => {
        await device.disconnect();
        console.log("Disconnected from the device");
        }, 10000);
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

start(thingy);
```

The following example will first connect to a thingy:52, and then read the current LED configuration. In the end we will set the LED to breathe mode, with an intensity of 50% and a delay of 1 second.

```javascript

import Thingy from "./js/thingy.js";

const thingy = new Thingy();

async function start(device) {
    try {
        await device.connect();

        const currentLedConfiguration = await device.led.get();
        console.log(currentLedConfiguration);
        
        const newLedConfiguration = {
            mode: "breathe",
            color: "cyan",
            intensity: 50,
            delay: 1000,
        }
        
        await device.led.set(newLedConfiguration);  
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

start(thingy);
```

**Note**: the Web Bluetooth API requires that a function trying to connect to a BLE device is initiated by a user action such as a mouse click.

### API documentation
Thingy offers several features, all of which rely on established BLE protocols for sending and receiving data. The BLE operations are abstracted away through the following operations:

| Operation | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| start/stop | Subscribes to a feature and relays any incoming data from that feature as an event |
| get | Reads data from the specified feature on Thingy |
| set | Writes data to the specified feature on Thingy |
